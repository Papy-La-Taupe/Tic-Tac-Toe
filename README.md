# Tic-Tac-Toe
A TOP project, to train on IIFE and global js logic

After finishing this I dabbled into basic AI programming and thought about implementing a minimax() algorithm to allow an AI assisted game.

Problem was, my code isn't at all compatible with it, creating two annoying situations :
    - the working understanding of the algorithm logic was very complicated (since the code isn't really compatible)
    - I would have needed to start almost 90% of my JS code from scratch (for the same reason) when AI compatibility was just a bonus possibility.

In the end, i studied the minimax() thoroughly, along with basic notions of recursive algorithm in general CS displays and pseudo-code, and cashed in a few hours of learning and tinkering. I will use this knowledge in my next project, keeping it in mind from the start of my planning.

For now tho, I'll leave this project in peace. It's elegant enough for it's propose, and allow me to continue my training. 

It's always the same logic, if on your way to Rome you stop to repair and enhance the path for each rock in the way, you'll end-up with a builder's empire, but you'll never see the Coliseum.

So i need to force myself to move on and wait for my next assignment to implement my newfound knowledge.
